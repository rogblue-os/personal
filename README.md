# personal


## Usage

- Install Fedora Silverblue 37
- Rebase using this image:
```
sudo rpm-ostree rebase --experimental ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/rogblue-os/personal:latest
```
## What is this
This is my personal image, which I decided to share.

This includes pretty much the base image and then my modifications on top of that. If you want a "base" image for your ROG laptop with the needed asusctl tools included, i recommend you use the [LAPTOP](https://github.com/rogblue-os/laptop)image.
